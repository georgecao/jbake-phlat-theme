*Unit Testing* is a development process in which smallest unit of an application code is tested to ensure expected working. [Kent Beck](https://twitter.com/KentBeck) developed Extreme Programming (XP), a software development methodology and unit testing evolved as a part of that methodology. In programming context, an unit could be a class, method, function or other smallest segment of code that can be tested and verified in isolation.
